Definition # What is business continuity and why is it important Share this item with your network By Site Editor Executive Editor Technology Writer ## What is business continuity Business continuity is an organizations ability to maintain critical business functions during a disaster and after it has occurred. Business continuity planning establishes processes and procedures that aim to prevent interruptions to and reestablish full day-to-day function to the organization as quickly and smoothly as possible. The most basic business continuity requirement is to keep essential functions up and running during a disaster and to recover with as little downtime as possible. A considers unpredictable events and potential threats, such as natural disasters, fires, disease outbreaks, pandemics, supply chain disruptions, cyber attacks and other external threats. A business continuity strategy is important for organizations of any size, but it might not be practical for any but the largest enterprises to maintain all functions for the duration of a disaster. According to many experts, the first step in is deciding what functions are essential and allocating the available budget accordingly. Once crucial components have been identified, administrators can put mechanisms in place. Technologies such as enable an organization to maintain up-to-date copies of data in geographically dispersed locations, not just in the primary data center. This helps data access functions continue uninterrupted if one location is disabled and protects against data loss. This article is part of ### Which also includes ## Why is business continuity important At a time when downtime is unacceptable, business continuity is critical. Downtime comes from a variety of sources. Some threats, such as cyber attacks and extreme weather, seem to be getting worse. According to Gartner, cyber attacks are and exploiting poor cybersecurity threat detection. Therefore, its important to have a business continuity plan in place that considers any potential disruptions to operations. The plan should enable the organization to keep running at least at a minimal level during a crisis. Business continuity helps the organization in responding quickly to an interruption. Strong business continuity saves money, time and company reputation. An extended outage risks financial, personal and reputational loss. Business continuity requires an organization to look at itself, analyze potential areas of weakness and gather key information -- such as contact lists and technical diagrams of systems -- that can be useful outside of disaster situations. In undertaking the business continuity planning process, an organization can improve its communication, technology and resilience. Business continuity might even be a requirement for legal or compliance reasons. Its important to understand which regulations affect a given organization, especially in an era of increased regulation.',\n",

With dedicated infrastructure and localized coverage, 5G private networks provide greater reliability and security than public or traditional wireless networks. They are becoming increasingly important in the digital transformation of and where a vast number of connected devices need to interact seamlessly. While private 5G networks have shown to be a pivotal solution for numerous businesses, it requires an initial investment of time, resources, and capital. The journey to building a wireless network is filled with challenges, including coverage, spectrum allocation, security, and more. In this article, we will explore some major challenges of deploying 5G private networks and share insights on how to overcome them, empowering you to navigate network design complexity and unlock the full potential of your private wireless network. Summary Challenges of private network planning 1. Obtaining the right frequency band 2. Optimizing coverage and avoiding interference 3. Adapting to indoor & outdoor environments 4. Integrating with existing infrastructure 5. Meeting regulation requirements Addressing private network challenges in 3 simple steps 1. Use 3D building models 2. Use wireless planning software 3. Lean on wireless network experts ## Challenges of private network planning & design Decades of assisting businesses in planning and deploying private networks have allowed Siradel to get acquainted with various indoor and outdoor environments and identify the major roadblocks in setting up 5G private networks. Whether in standard or more complex environments, it is necessary to anticipate challenges to better maximize network performance and cost efficiency. ### 1. Obtaining the right frequency band Different frequency bands offer varying characteristics in terms of coverage, speed, and penetration capability. Obtaining the right band that aligns with the networks requirements is essential for optimal performance. Higher frequencies offer faster speeds but struggle with penetration through buildings, while lower frequencies provide better coverage but might have limited capacity. Whether dealing with indoor, outdoor or hybrid environments, the frequency band selected can significantly impact network performance and coverage. Precisely defining your needs at the very beginning of your private network project enables better anticipation and decision-making in this critical aspect. However, keep in mind that the choice of the frequency band will ultimately be influenced by regulatory mandates and spectrum allocation considerations. ### 2. Optimizing coverage and avoiding interference 5G private networks are appealing due to the high-performance, security, and flexibility they provide. Its important to maximize coverage while avoiding interferences to ensure that you get the most out of your investment. The key lies in deploying the correct number of antennas and positioning them accurately. Simply installing more antennas does not guarantee improved connectivity it does, however, increase costs. In crowded environments like stadiums or cities, operators need a network that enables users to benefit from high performance and low latency connectivity, while reducing interferences between cells and complex radio propagation behaviors, like diffraction and diffuse scattering.! To achieve promised 5G speeds and low latency while managing expenses efficiently, network designers must implement a strategic deployment of cells or repeaters. Propagation modeling is therefore a crucial element in determining the required number of 5G cells and their optimal placement. ### 3. Adapting to indoor and outdoor environments Designing private networks requires careful consideration of the local environment. Complex environments like warehouses, ports, airports or cities, are even more challenging to comprehend and adapt to due to their unique characteristics. In such environments, signals struggle to penetrate certain building materials, leading to potential coverage gaps and reduced performance indoors. To overcome signal attenuation, additional infrastructure might be',\n",

Digital twins are reshaping the foundations of engineering by combining data from human experts with machine intelligence to drive the evolution of work in new and unexplored ways. By detecting anomalies and automating repair processes, digital twins can model and simulate entire procedures and processes. Most importantly, the technology enables firms to anticipate problems and prevent mistakes before they occur. Digital twins consist of three components 1. A data model 2. A set of analytics or algorithms 3. A set of executive controls. A key feature of any IoT implementation, digital twin technology enables companies to simulate processes and improve operations over time. Manufacturers tend to use digital twin technology to improve operations such as plant processes and machine performance in order to optimize supply chains. half of all large industrial companies will use This is in large part because digital twins are now driving new business models and evolving industrial automation. Despite this, many businesses have been slow to embrace digital twin technology because it is complicated to implement. Once implemented, however, digital twin technology can add value to traditional analytical approaches by situational awareness From industrial planning and manufacturing to wind farms and digital twins provide real-time and predictive analytics that measure and optimize the operation of engineered systems and processes. These virtual doppelgangers assist industry personnel to test systems virtually before applying changes in the physical world. Lessons learned in the virtual world can be invaluable in improving machines and systems in the physical environment.! Siemens demonstrates how digital twins can improve multiple areas of industrial automation digital twins offer tools for training and for accelerating the learning capacities of an organization. Merging digital twins with AI and machine learning, digital twins can feed on multiple data in order to improve real-time working functions. Digital twins draw data from a number of sources, including real-time control systems, historical sensor data, and asset management systems. Digital twin technology is dramatically reshaping the design and engineering process, but it is not radically new',\n",
       " 'Summarize the following document: White Paper Simplifying 5G with the Network Digital Twin Introduction As telecommunications technology transitions from 4G to the incredible promise and potential of 5G, one thing is clear the new technology is not just an incremental upgrade, but an exponential leap in terms of speed, accuracy, latency and complexity. Indeed, the complicated nature of 5G is both one of its great advantagesallowing incredible next-generation capabilities in automation, robotics, virtual reality and moreand a huge challenge when it comes to safe, secure, successful implementation. The many elements that comprise and impact a 5G network or application are constantly and quickly changing. Thats largely due to the fact that 5G makes communications and connectivity move much faster than ever before. And, as with any relatively new technology, there are considerable risks and uncertainties. Even 5G standards are still a moving target, fluctuating and evolving along with the emerging industry as a whole. All of these factors add to 5Gs complexity. One undeniable takeaway regarding the implementation of 5G applications and ecosystems is that the traditional ways of testing and assuring are inadequate and need to be augmented with new techniques and processes. Instead of just running tests in a physical lab setting and then performing infrequent reviews with occasional updates after installation, 5G requires testing that is always on and that can implement solutions, whenever needed, in near real-time. Less complexity and more simplification are whats called for to achieve a less costly and convoluted, more timely and holistic way of approaching the vetting and verification of 5G products, services and applications. Fortunately, Spirent Communications has answers. 2 Simplifying 5G with the Network Digital TwinA New Approach to Testing and Assurance With the advent of 5G, which in many ways is a brand new, very different technology compared to 4G, Spirent has been leading the way in developing solutions for research universities and industries that adopt a fresh approach to testing and service assurance. As the stakes continue to rise, as more and more investment dollars and valuable partnerships are on the line, these dynamic new testing procedures are vital to moving 5G applications forward. Thats why Spirent is working closely with university R&D programs and onoff campus communications projects as well as innovative companies who are embracing 5G and Industry 4.0 to create the smart factories, manufacturing and logistics centers of the future. Out of the Lab, into the Network The testing and assurance of 4G and earlier telecommunications technologies typically took place in lab settings, where each procedure was costly in time and money and required careful planning and bundling to effectively manage expenses. Labs are still in use today, but less so because planning, modeling and optimizing 5G in this way is often prohibitively costly and complex. The technology requires extremely high levels of accuracy, speed and latency that can be difficult to manage. There can be constantly changing problems with signal interference, things moving around and hard surfaces that reflect waves to cause distortions and false readings. There are also issues with capacity and processes being dynamically allocated from the core to the edge and networks becoming virtualized, disaggregated and sliced. For these reasons, testing and assurance has increasingly moved to automated software that runs via emulation on a copy of the network for which the 5G applications are intended. This allows products and services to be cost-effectively developed, monitored and tested for performance around the clock, and quickly repaired when delays or other problems occur. Emulation, Not Simulation Those wordsemulation and simulationseem so alike. There are, however, subtle differences that end up having a profound impact on testing and assurance. While simulation is a system that behaves similarly to something else to provide an idea',\n",

       " 'Summarize the following document: # What is business continuity Business continuity can be defined as the processes, procedures, decisions and activities to ensure that an organization can continue to function through an operational interruption. In other words it is about making proactive and reactive plans to help your organization avoid crises and disasters and to be able to quickly return to business as usual should they occur. Business continuity involves two distinct areas Business continuity planning - where a plan is developed that, when implemented, will help to prevent operational interruptions, crises and disasters happening and will help the organization quickly return to a state of business as usual should any of these events occur. Once it has been prepared the business continuity plan must be tested and exercised to ensure that it will perform as anticipated. Business continuity management - this is The ongoing management of the business continuity plans to ensure that they are always current and available and The ongoing management of operational resilience and process availability within an organization, with the aim of ensuring that the organization experiences the minimum possible day-to-day disruption. ### What are the outputs of a business continuity program Business continuity achieves various things for organizations, with the degree of success in each area dependent on the amount of effort, skill, resource and commitment provided by the organization for business continuity activities. There will be a number of outcomes in every business continuity program which are specific to the organization in question, but the following are outcomes which should be achieved by every organization which takes business continuity seriously A deeper and clearer understanding of the organization The processes involved in developing the initial business continuity plan and then in maintaining and managing the BCP result in a clear overview of the overall organization its structures, dependencies, suppliers and stakeholders. This information is not only essential for business continuity management it can also help planning and strategy in other non-related areas of organizational development and management. Proactive measures Proactive measures are designed for the prevention of interruptions to organizational activities. The essence of good business continuity management is the identification and implementation of measures which can be put in place to proactively prevent operational interruptions taking place, and to prevent crises and disasters occurring. Business continuity management, at its highest level, is about keeping organizations operating at their maximum capability. Reactive measures Reactive measures are designed for recovery from interruptions to organizational activities. Business continuity management programs includes plans for the reactive measures that will be taken should the proactive measures that are in place fail, become overwhelmed, or are bypassed by some unforeseen and unexpected crisis. Reactive measures enable the organization to return to an acceptable level of operations within a desired timescale following an interruption, disaster or crisis. Culture change Business continuity management programs involve an exploration of organizational culture. Effective programs will utilise change management techniques to ensure that the organization encourages a culture where all employees are sufficiently aware of everyday risks and their individual responsibility to report, manage and mitigate risks. ### Further resources ### Additional Resources ### A website you can trust The entire Continuity Central website is scanned daily by Sucuri to ensure that no malware exists within the site.

       " 'Summarize the following document: What is a digital twin Explore IBMs digital twin solution Subscribe to Sustainability Updates! What is a digital twin A digital twin is a virtual representation of an object or system designed to reflect a physical object accurately. It spans the objects lifecycle, is updated from real-time data and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help make decisions. How does a digital twin work The studied objectfor example, a wind turbineis outfitted with various sensors related to vital areas of functionality. These sensors produce data about different aspects of the physical objects performance, such as energy output, temperature, weather conditions and more. The processing system receives this information and actively applies it to the digital copy. After being provided with the relevant data, the digital model can be utilized to conduct various simulations, analyze performance problems and create potential enhancements. The ultimate objective is to obtain valuable knowledge that can be used to improve the original physical entity. Digital twins versus simulations Although simulations and digital twins both utilize digital models to replicate a systems various processes, a digital twin is actually a virtual environment, which makes it considerably richer for study. The difference between a digital twin and a simulation is largely a matter of scale While a simulation typically studies 1 particular process, a digital twin can run any number of useful simulations to study multiple processes. The differences dont end there. For example, simulations usually dont benefit from having real-time data. But digital twins are designed around a two-way flow of information that occurs when object sensors provide relevant data to the system processor and then happens again when insights created by the processor are shared back with the original source object. By having better and constantly updated data related to a wide range of areas, combined with the added computing power that accompanies a virtual environment, digital twins can study more issues from far more vantage points than standard simulations can, with greater ultimate potential to improve products and processes. Ebook Your guide on GHG emissions accounting Learn about the processes used to manage environmental performance data and the steps required to account for greenhouse gas emissions. Related content Register for the guide to the EUs CSRD Types of digital twins There are various types of digital twins depending on the level of product magnification. The biggest difference between these twins is the area of application. It is common to have different types of digital twins co-exist within a system or process. Lets go through the types of digital twins to learn the differences and how they are applied. Component twins or Parts twins Component twins are the basic unit of a digital twin, the smallest example of a functioning component. Parts twins are roughly the same thing, but pertain to components of slightly less importance. Asset twins When two or more components work together, they form what is known as an asset. Asset twins let you study the interaction of those components, creating a wealth of performance data that can be processed and then turned into actionable insights. System or Unit twins The next level of magnification involves system or unit twins, which enable you to see how different assets come together to form an entire functioning system. System twins provide visibility regarding the interaction of assets and may suggest performance enhancements. Process twins Process twins, the macro level of magnification, reveal how systems work together to create an entire production facility. Are those systems all synchronized to operate at peak efficiency, or will delays in one system affect others Process twins can help determine the precise timing schemes that ultimately influence overall effectiveness. History of digital twin technology The idea of digital twin technology was first voiced in 1991, with the publication of Mirror Worlds, by David Gelernter. However, Dr',\n",

November 9, 2021 by Share Email 0 If a virtual tree falls and hits a 5G antenna in Stockholm, does it make a sound in Chicago Thanks to Ericsson, the answer is yes. Everything from the locations of trees to the height and composition of buildings is crucial because they impact 5G wireless signals in networks serving smartphones, tablets and millions of other internet-connected devices. The Stockholm-based maker of telecommunications equipment is combining decades of radio network simulation expertise with a real-time virtual world simulation and collaboration platform for 3D workflows. In NVIDIA Omniverse, Ericsson is building city-scale to help accurately simulate the interplay between 5G cells and the environment for maximum performance and coverage. The rollout of 5G networks is creating new challenges, and with over 15 million microcells and towers to be deployed globally by network operators over the next five years, its no small undertaking. ## The 5G Challenge 5G enables a multitude of new use cases ranging from IoT and manufacturing to self-driving cars and telehealth. Networks serving these use cases operate in vastly different environments. New types of devices will enter the networks, and the number of devices will grow by orders of magnitude in the next few years. These factors make the design and development of 5G products and networks very complex. Without a digital-twin approach, the interaction between radio transmitters, the environment, and humans and devices that are on the move had to be understood with less detail. And many features had to be field tested only after the networks were already built. Before Omniverse, coverage and capacity of networks was analyzed by simplifying many aspects of the complex interactions, such as the physical phenomena and mobility aspects, said Germán Ceballos, a researcher at Ericsson. Now well be able to simulate network deployments and features in a highly detailed scale using Omniverse. Creating an end-to-end city-scale digital twin results in faster development cycles, better network optimization and ultimately better, swifter networks because it delivers fast insights into what products to install where, Ceballos says. ## GPU-Powered Insights Ericsson and NVIDIA entered a strategic partnership in 2019 with the goal of cross-pollinating technologies and challenges between their respective domains. The 3D community has historically been fragmented along several proprietary and competing formats and tool chains. This creates unacceptable degrees of lock-in and limited abilities to extend to new simulation use cases. The NVIDIA Omniverse platform provides key technologies that allow Ericsson to accurately model network performance across dynamic environmental elements. NVIDIA RTX-accelerated real-time ray tracing allows researchers to see precise representations of signal quality at every point in the city, in real time, which wasnt possible before. This means Ericsson can experiment with its telecom products such as beam-forming and explore their impact interactively and instantaneously. s city-scale digital twin, made in NVIDIA Omniverse, simulates proper placement of 5G microcells and towers to help maximum performance and coverage. Plus, with emerging Omniverse platform capabilities such as network engineers could soon put on a virtual-reality headset and explore any part of any model, at 11 scale, tuning the parameters, antenna and literally seeing the effects things that arent visible in real life. For Ericsson, the Omniverse digital twin offers universal telecom',\n",

These features are advancing the capabilities of digital twins and the value organizations can gain from them. What are the benefits of building a digital twin simulation on a 5G network ## Capability for Large-Scale Real-Time Monitoring Low latency and high bandwidth are the top benefits of 5G. One exciting application for these features is 5G can handle expansive IoT networks. It can transmit large quantities of real-time data and continue to do so efficiently as an organization scales up its IoT infrastructure. This process is helpful for everyday operations as well as long-term growth. Organizations can factor real-time data into digital twin design and use it to monitor the success of new optimizations. They dont have to pick and choose a few IoT devices to pull data from, either. 5G networks have the bandwidth to handle information from hundreds of sensors at once. As a result, organizations can access more real-time data and create more accurate digital twins. ## Enhanced Real-Time Data Transfers The estimated which is 10 times faster than the top speed of 4G. This speed allows digital twins to transfer more data in less time compared to older network versions. Its especially helpful for large environments with data coming from hundreds or thousands of sensors and devices. On a 5G network, organizations can move that data to their digital twin efficiently. This means organizations can create a digital twin that uses real-time data. The digital twin could adapt to real-world conditions as data comes in. The machine learning algorithm behind the digital twin could even learn from the data in real time. This results in more realistic, accurate digital twins. Plus, rapid data transfers with 5G make it easy to update a digital twins dataset. In fact, regularly updating 3D reality capture scans for digital twins by ensuring the digital twin always has the most accurate information. It allows organizations to catch mistakes and identify new opportunities right away, maximizing the value of a digital twin. also make it easier to use cloud computing for digital twins. Cloud computing makes digital twin technology more accessible to organizations that lack robust on-premises computing hardware. With 5G, these organizations can send data to the cloud just as fast as an on-prem data transfer, making cloud computing the perfect solution for digital twin development. ## Improved Support for Edge Computing is a game changer for IoT and real-time monitoring. Combining edge computing with digital twins lets organizations build responsive, secure, highly realistic simulations. This ability is especially helpful in an and workflows. Smart automation requires rapid, continuous updates from sensor data. Edge computing makes that possible. 5G networks offer the latency and security to support edge computing at scale. A 5G network can act as the ideal platform for connecting an edge computing environment and a digital twin. Doing so can lead to streamlined real-time updates, faster digital twin rendering, and more.

A phone is no longer just for calls or messages, a car likely knows the way to your destination better than you do, and our industries and cities are becoming smarter and more connected by the day, powered by 5G and IoT. Were seeing our future being built around us - a future of highly complex networks and interconnected digital ecosystems. With enormous volumes of real-time data constantly being generated by every device, managing these networks and ensuring they operate efficiently and sustainably will depend heavily upon artificial intelligence and machine learning. But training poses a challenge. After all, how do you safely train an ML algorithm to learn and take responsive action in a live, dynamic network where downtime is not an option Thats where come into play.! Accurate representation of an actual site in a digital twin ### What is a digital twin A digital twin is essentially a copy - a software representation of all the assets, information and processes present in the real-world version, but based in the cloud. Digital twins open up a virtual world of possibility - a safe simulated testing environment in which you can train and play out what-if scenarios to your hearts content, with no risk to the real-world counterpart. ### Exploring digital twin use cases While they may sound like science fiction, digital twins are already being leveraged in commercial solutions, unlocking the potential of AI, data & digitalization to enable the mobile networks of the future. Here we explore three real-world digital twin examples and discover how this technology is opening up new possibilities for optimized, automated and future-proof networks. ### Use case 1 - Network Digital Twins a safe approach to automation for 5G networks A Network Digital Twin models what we think of as the invisible network the signals, coverage, interference and traffic behavior, including user mobility across frequency layers. The digital twin ensures a safe approach to optimization, a vital factor when it comes to sensitive parameters, like radiated power, for example. In Switzerland, our customer Swisscom runs the top-scoring network in the world according to umlauts international benchmark rankings for 2021. But they are also subject to some of the strictest regulations when it comes to radiated power. Without changes to the existing infrastructure, regulations would only allow deployment of a few new 5G sites with low power, leading to spotty coverage on a new low-band layer which would be used by both 4G and 5G New Radio. So how could we reduce the transmitted power to make headroom for the new layer, without ',\n",

Indeed, the complicated nature of 5G is both one of its great advantagesallowing incredible next-generation capabilities in automation, robotics, virtual reality and moreand a huge challenge when it comes to safe, secure, successful implementation. The many elements that comprise and impact a 5G network or application are constantly and quickly changing. Thats largely due to the fact that 5G makes communications and connectivity move much faster than ever before. And, as with any relatively new technology, there are considerable risks and uncertainties. Even 5G standards are still a moving target, fluctuating and evolving along with the emerging industry as a whole. All of these factors add to 5Gs complexity. One undeniable takeaway regarding the implementation of 5G applications and ecosystems is that the traditional ways of testing and assuring are inadequate and need to be augmented with new techniques and processes. Instead of just running tests in a physical lab setting and then performing infrequent reviews with occasional updates after installation, 5G requires testing that is always on and that can implement solutions, whenever needed, in near real-time. Less complexity and more simplification are whats called for to achieve a less costly and convoluted, more timely and holistic way of approaching the vetting and verification of 5G products, services and applications. Fortunately, Spirent Communications has answers. 2 Simplifying 5G with the Network Digital TwinA New Approach to Testing and Assurance With the advent of 5G, which in many ways is a brand new, very different technology compared to 4G, Spirent has been leading the way in developing solutions for research universities and industries that adopt a fresh approach to testing and service assurance. As the stakes continue to rise, as more and more investment dollars and valuable partnerships are on the line, these dynamic new testing procedures are vital to moving 5G applications forward. Thats why Spirent is working closely with university R&D programs and onoff campus communications projects as well as innovative companies who are embracing 5G and Industry 4.0 to create the smart factories, manufacturing and logistics centers of the future. Out of the Lab, into the Network The testing and assurance of 4G and earlier telecommunications technologies typically took place in lab settings, where each procedure was costly in time and money and required careful planning and bundling to effectively manage expenses. Labs are still in use today, but less so because planning, modeling and optimizing 5G in this way is often prohibitively costly and complex. The technology requires extremely high levels of accuracy, speed and latency that can be difficult to manage. There can be constantly changing problems with signal interference, things moving around and hard surfaces that reflect waves to cause distortions and false readings. There are also issues with capacity and processes being dynamically allocated from the core to the edge and networks becoming virtualized, disaggregated and sliced. For these reasons, testing and assurance has increasingly moved to automated software that runs via emulation on a copy of the network for which the 5G applications are intended. This allows products and services to be cost-effectively developed, monitored and tested for performance around the clock, and quickly repaired when delays or other problems occur. Emulation, Not Simulation Those wordsemulation and simulationseem so alike. There are, however, subtle differences that end up having a profound impact on testing and assurance.

Image courtesy of 123.RF. # Three ways digital twins can optimize Open RAN 5G networks ByDuc To, Principal System Architect, CTO Office, Rakuten Symphony & Kexuan Sun, Principal Wireless Architect, CTO Office, Rakuten Symphony January 30, 2024 RAN Forum As 5G mobile networks grow in complexity, its becoming impossible for human network engineers to manage the network without automation. The evolution from rules-based automation to the use of AIML is creating a category of management solutions that can anticipate problems in the network and fix them in real time. Digital twins are broadly used in complex digital systems that need an exact mirror image of the digital environment in all its complexity so that testing and optimization can be done without disrupting the real-world system at work. In mobile networks, the use of digital twins provides the modeling and simulation capabilities to train these AI-based network management systems. ## Digital twins and RICs working together To add new management functionality and control to Open RAN, the O-RAN ALLIANCE created standards for the non-real-time and near real-time RAN intelligent controllers. RICs take the role of central controllers for network operations, including the tasks related to radio resource management. The operational tasks are optimized by employing the right apps in the RICs, wherein AIML becomes a powerful tool that can potentially tackle many complex problems that are difficult or unsolvable today. For calibration, AIML models require plenty of data, which may not be available at the initial phase of network rollout. The lack of data for training purposes can be overcome by a digital twin, whose models can generate data by themselves. Then, the digital twin evolves with the expansion of the real network and there is a creation of a cycle of data exchange 1 the digital twin supplies meaningful data to RICs to train AIML models, which are used to infer optimal network configurations 2 RIC feeds the updated network configurations to the real network to maintain network operations and 3 the data reflecting the health and efficiency of the real network are gathered to recalibrate the models in the digital twin. There are three building blocks for creating an Open RAN digital twin The modelling entities that create accurate digital replicas of different aspects of a RAN network. Data captured from the Open RAN standardized interfaces is used to synchronize the models with the live physical network. The RAN Scenario Generator is powered by AIML technology and automatically parameterizes the models to generate billions of training scenarios for the AIML models. The RAN Scenario Generator can also automatically evolve itself based on the performance feedback from the RAN analytic module, generating more and more challenging training data set for the AIML intelligence and performance to continuously improve. Advanced Visualization simplifies the data and presents it to network engineers when their input is needed. Examples of modelling entities are Modeling Physical RF Propagation Ray tracing is increasingly being used to realistically model the physical RF propagation characteristics in the mobilityRF model used by the network. This technique estimates the RF propagation characteristics and impact of buildings and other obstructions based on calculating the path gains of propagation paths through a geometrical region of varying velocity, absorption characteristics, and multiple reflecting surfaces.

It can also help create resilience to withstand negative impacts and continue operations when a disruption occurs. Its about protecting your business and the stakeholders who rely on it the customers who purchase your products or services, the owners and shareholders with a financial stake in the success of the company and the employees who make their livelihood serving your business and its customers. The primary goals of planning are 1. Maintain a minimum level of operations during disruption 2. Reduce recovery time Having a business continuity program in place, along with associated contingency plans, is key to helping an organization achieve these goals. ## Disaster recovery, crisis response, emergency response and incident response The terminology used by business continuity professionals can be confusing. For example, the term d isaster recovery may be used to describe business continuity, but its typically reserved to reference strategic plans for recovery and resumption of only critical information technology and telecommunications assets during a disaster. Crisis response, e mergency response and incident response are terms that refer to the immediate actions taken during an incident to preserve life, prevent injury and prevent further damage to property. Contingency planning refers to specific tactics or actions taken during a disruption. Each of these are among the elements included in a broader overall business continuity management plan. The International Standards Organization, in May of 2012, published the first edition standard ISO 22301, Societal security Business continuity management systems Requirements. This document serves as a consensus standard specifying the requirements for setting up and managing an effective Business Continuity Management System. In summary, a Business Continuity Management System can be considered a suite of documented policies, organizational structure, analyses, assessments, plans, procedures and responsibilities to help ensure an organization does not experience an unacceptable interruption in the event of a disruption to its business operations. At the core of Business Continuity Management are four main elements 1. Crisis response and communications 2. Risk management 3. IT disaster recovery 4. Business contingency or resumption planning and recovery ## Is your business prepared for an unexpected disruption or disaster The risk of disruptive incidents to businesses and organizations is increasing. Recent increases in frequency and severity of weather-related disasters, rains associated with landslides and flooding, severe windstorms, and even drought conditions that can lead to increased exposure to wildfires. Additional disruption examples include Manufacturers relying on just-in-time supplies and inventory Suppliers with an increased risk of supply chain disruptions Livestock producers face increased risk for disease outbreaks that can wipe out poultry, swine or other animals Computer hackers create increased risk of security breach and denial-of-service attacks Food manufacturers and retail restaurants face the risk of food contamination and associated customer illness, often leading to bad publicity and risks to their reputation. How vulnerable is your business to threats of disruption How safe are your resources What is your tolerance for downtime These are all things to consider when developing a business continuity plan. Identifying key operations and dependencies, completing a business impact analysis and conducting a risk assessment are some of the components of business continuity planning that will help you answer these questions. The results can help guide your determination for appropriate risk management techniques to employ and the specific business contingency plans to develop as a part of your overall business continuity management plan. ## What keeps many businesses from developing and implementing a continuity',\n",

One exciting application for these features is 5G can handle expansive IoT networks. It can transmit large quantities of real-time data and continue to do so efficiently as an organization scales up its IoT infrastructure. This process is helpful for everyday operations as well as long-term growth. Organizations can factor real-time data into digital twin design and use it to monitor the success of new optimizations. They dont have to pick and choose a few IoT devices to pull data from, either. 5G networks have the bandwidth to handle information from hundreds of sensors at once. As a result, organizations can access more real-time data and create more accurate digital twins. ## Enhanced Real-Time Data Transfers The estimated which is 10 times faster than the top speed of 4G. This speed allows digital twins to transfer more data in less time compared to older network versions. Its especially helpful for large environments with data coming from hundreds or thousands of sensors and devices. On a 5G network, organizations can move that data to their digital twin efficiently. This means organizations can create a digital twin that uses real-time data. The digital twin could adapt to real-world conditions as data comes in. The machine learning algorithm behind the digital twin could even learn from the data in real time. This results in more realistic, accurate digital twins. Plus, rapid data transfers with 5G make it easy to update a digital twins dataset. In fact, regularly updating 3D reality capture scans for digital twins by ensuring the digital twin always has the most accurate information. It allows organizations to catch mistakes and identify new opportunities right away, maximizing the value of a digital twin. also make it easier to use cloud computing for digital twins. Cloud computing makes digital twin technology more accessible to organizations that lack robust on-premises computing hardware. With 5G, these organizations can send data to the cloud just as fast as an on-prem data transfer, making cloud computing the perfect solution for digital twin development. ## Improved Support for Edge Computing is a game changer for IoT and real-time monitoring.

How Verizon is using digital twins to reduce energy costs Operators are striving to use technology to improve the energy efficiency of their networks as we showcased in our recent report. Verizon, for example, has been able to reduce energy costs by over $100 million a year by using network digital twins to build energy consumption models, according to Shankar Arumugavelu, Chief Digital and Information Officer, The creation of network digital twins is part of a long-term investment by Verizon in advanced analytics that will help it optimize network investments based on total cost of ownership, while improving customer experience. Michael Raj, Vice President of Network Enablement, explained how Verizon uses the virtual representation of its physical network to analyze and predict the performance, cost and efficiency of its network sites and equipment.! Creating a digital copy of the real world requires multiple layers of interrelated data and the better the data, the better the twin. Therefore, one of Verizons first steps was to standardize data for each of the different layers, including network performance and energy billing. This included standardizing data related to the configuration, make and model of antennae across multiple different sites. For although Verizon already had the data, vendors A, B and C have different terminologies, explains Raj. As a result, Verizon developed common terminologies and a common index to mine this data across common standards. Other data standardization work included aggregating the billing systems for different utility providers, cleaning up the data and matching it to the sites. One of the advantages of having standardized data about energy costs, consumption and network performance is it makes it much easier to identify and analyze anomalies. We were able to gather the power consumption data for all of the cell sites and see some crazy anomalies, says Raj. As a result, we could question why this costs $1,000 versus the same configuration elsewhere, which only costs $500 and identify specific problems related to those outliers, as well as make recommendations for how to remediate those situations when found in the future. Identifying room for improvement The information also helps Verizon compare how different vendors equipment consumes energy in the field as opposed to in a lab and use the results to push for better performance. Lets say for 100 GB of capacity, vendor A proves to be more 35% more efficient in practice than vendor B, now we can push vendor B to create a more energy efficient solution, says Raj. And because the digital twin provides a standardized environment in which to visualize issues and test potential solutions, it encourages teams to take a more creative approach to improving operations. Its allowed us to increase the ideation across our operations team now that they have a single source to look at how the standard differs across networks, lines of business, services and types of technology, explains Raj. Having a clear picture of energy consumption across all its sites also helps Verizon make decommissioning decisions and optimize sleep settings at sites that house both 4G and 5G networks. When using sleep mode to reduce energy consumption in the middle of the night when there is no traffic, Verizon is able to observe the delta in terms of savings and calculate ROI. The data gathered also feeds into sustainability reporting Verizon can use the network digital twin to quickly identify which locations rely on renewable energy, for example, when calculating its GHG emissions. In addition, Verizon uses its network digital',\n",
       " 'Summarize the following document: White Paper Simplifying 5G with the Network Digital Twin Introduction As telecommunications technology transitions from 4G to the incredible promise and potential of 5G, one thing is clear the new technology is not just an incremental upgrade, but an exponential leap in terms of speed, accuracy, latency and complexity. Indeed, the complicated nature of 5G is both one of its great advantagesallowing incredible next-generation capabilities in automation, robotics, virtual reality and moreand a huge challenge when it comes to safe, secure, successful implementation. The many elements that comprise and impact a 5G network or application are constantly and quickly changing. Thats largely due to the fact that 5G makes communications and connectivity move much faster than ever before. And, as with any relatively new technology, there are considerable risks and uncertainties. Even 5G standards are still a moving target, fluctuating and evolving along with the emerging industry as a whole. All of these factors add to 5Gs complexity. One undeniable takeaway regarding the implementation of 5G applications and ecosystems is that the traditional ways of testing and assuring are inadequate and need to be augmented with new techniques and processes. Instead of just running tests in a physical lab setting and then performing infrequent reviews with occasional updates after installation, 5G requires testing that is always on and that can implement solutions, whenever needed, in near real-time. Less complexity and more simplification are whats called for to achieve a less costly and convoluted, more timely and holistic way of approaching the vetting and verification of 5G products, services and applications. Fortunately, Spirent Communications has answers. 2 Simplifying 5G with the Network Digital TwinA New Approach to Testing and Assurance With the advent of 5G, which in many ways is a brand new, very different technology compared to 4G, Spirent has been leading the way in developing solutions for research universities and industries that adopt a fresh approach to testing and service assurance. As the stakes continue to rise, as more and more investment dollars and valuable partnerships are on the line, these dynamic new testing procedures are vital to moving 5G applications forward. Thats why Spirent is working closely with university R&D programs and onoff campus communications projects as well as innovative companies who are embracing 5G and Industry 4.0 to create the smart factories, manufacturing and logistics centers of the future. Out of the Lab, into the Network The testing and assurance of 4G and earlier telecommunications technologies typically took place in lab settings, where each procedure was costly in time and money and required careful planning and bundling to effectively manage expenses. Labs are still in use today, but less so because planning, modeling and optimizing 5G in this way is often prohibitively costly and complex. The technology requires extremely high levels of accuracy, speed and latency that can be difficult to manage. There can be constantly changing problems with signal interference, things moving around and hard surfaces that reflect waves to cause distortions and false readings. There are also issues with capacity and processes being dynamically allocated from the core to the edge and networks becoming virtualized, disaggregated and sliced. For these reasons, testing and assurance has increasingly moved to automated software that runs via emulation on a copy of the network for which the 5G applications are intended. This allows products and services to be cost-effectively developed, monitored and tested for performance around the clock, and quickly repaired when delays or other problems occur. Emulation, Not Simulation Those wordsemulation and simulationseem so alike. There are, however, subtle differences that end up having a profound impact on testing and assurance. While simulation is a system that behaves similarly to something else to provide an idea',\n",

Learn how defense organizations can design and test 5G spectral agility across complex mesh networks and Open RAN solutions. Defense organizations have long been challenged to ensure radio signals are transmitted and delivered securely and effectively. For government and military, the promise of 5G is very much about resilient operations especially in contested and congested environments. 5G promises enormous capabilities with a capacity to connect massive numbers of people, machines and devices using high-speed connections. 5G also introduces complexity, with numerous frequency ranges and new technologies. When it comes to radio network design and spectral agility, a range of key variables must be addressed to ensure the success of critical ground-to-ground, ground-to-air, ship-to-shore, and air-to-air communications. What are those variables How can a Network Digital Twin uniquely help defense organizations test for the myriad combinations This blog explores how testing spectral agility, mesh networks and Open RAN 5G solutions can ensure designs for superior and reliable communications in the worlds most challenging environments. ## Six Key Variables of Assured Radio Network Communications Long before 5G is integrated into civil and defense networks, government must be assured the technology will work as intended in live, often rigorous, and demanding environments. When designing radio networks and devices for military use, six key variables must be addressed to ensure reliable communications 1. Distance With greater distance from radio antennas, especially with satellite communications, the communication path is longer and signal strength will be reduced by the time it reaches the end device. 2. Reflections Radio signals reflect off different types of atmospheric conditions and solid materials. That may cause multi-path propagation, where a signal reaches the receiving antenna by two or more paths. 3. Blockers Numerous obstacles can fully block or partially absorb signals. Rough terrain, buildings and certain armored vehicle materials are examples of potential blockers. 4. Interference and noise Other radio communications, additional electronic devices, atmospheric conditions, and many other factors all contribute to the critical issue of signal interference, which can distort communications or make them difficult to hear. 5. Motion Sounds are in motion, as are people, ground vehicles, nautical vessels, and aircraft and all at different speeds. Complexity of motion, such as the Doppler effects change in sound wave frequencies produced by a source in motion, impacts how radio communications behave and perform. 6. Bad actors Spoofing and jamming are intentional interference methods that bad actors use to inject inaccurate information into communications or to prevent essential signal delivery. The only way to know these variables or combinations of variables have been addressed, is to have the right testing strategy with the right capabilities and expertise. This often entails comprehensive and custom testing, which can require an inordinate amount of time and money, especially with internal test teams that need to ramp up on the evolving complexities of 5G technology. This is where a 5G Network Digital Twin can play an essential role. ## How a Digital Twins Channel Emulation Helps Build Spectral Resilience A 5G Digital Twin is a software emulation of the 5G physical network.

A digital twin is a digital representation of a real-world object synchronized at a specified periodicity and fidelity. The original concept emerged decades ago, based on ideas that first arose in science fiction and in the Apollo program. The digital twins used today in industries such as aerospace, automotive, energy and manufacturing have been created fit for purpose to improve processes, products and business outcomes by replicating the relevant aspects of reality in a virtual environment. They add value by combining data and knowledge with various analytics and visualization tools, and they are regularly synchronized to keep the real and virtual worlds in sync with each other. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in applying the digital twin concept on a much broader scale. In the case of mobile networks, digital twins can be applied to a broad set of use cases within both the communication service providers and the vendors own organizations, making it possible to both enhance existing capabilities and introduce entirely new functionality. ## Characteristics of a digital twin Both the high interest in digital twins and their diverse applicability have resulted in many definitions of the term. At Ericsson, we have adapted the Digital Twin Consortiums definition for mobile networks.',\n",

Solving this challenge may require technology leaders to rethink and revamp their traditional IT infrastructures. The Internet of Things is rapidly emerging as a technological necessity for modern enterprises. And realizing this, businesses are ramping up their efforts to implement and expand their IoT networks. However, while businesses are increasingly investing in IoT initiatives, they are running into multiple challenges associated with the technologys adoption. Among the most significant problems to IoT adoption are the need for high-capacity communication networks, the security implications of using a myriad of smart connected devices, and the problem of data integration in IoT. The emergence of technologies like 5G communication can potentially solve the problem of the need for high-bandwidth communication which will enable high volume transfer of data across the IoT networks. Similarly, the use of technologies like networks. However, the challenge posed by the need for data integration in IoT has yet to receive a definite solution. Read on to know why there is a need for data integration in IoT, why it is difficult, and what are the potential solutions to the problem. ## Understanding the need for data integration in IoT Ever since its emergence, among IoTs primary appealing factors has been its ability to offer remote control and visibility over enterprise-wide processes. IoT is also viewed as something that would be instrumental in the end-to-end integration of various business units and processes, which can lead to better coordination between these entities, leading to enhanced business performance. However, business and technology leaders are increasingly emphasizing the fact that the by it. And to leverage the data for any practical purpose, it is important to collate the data generated by the different sources. This need for collating data, or data integration in IoT, as it is known, can be more challenging than for earlier forms of analytics like big data. But why is it necessary to collate IoT data, you ask Put simply, data integration is necessary for enterprises and the chief decision-makers in these enterprises to have the complete picture of whats happening throughout their organization and its environment. Different parts of an enterprise -- through its growing network IoT sensors and other data collection devices -- constantly gather valuable data regarding different aspects of the business, in different forms, and in unprecedentedly large volumes. These bits of information can be used as they are collected for making quick, short-term decisions that drive the daily operations. In short, the data gathered can be used to make the enterprise and its components more responsive to exigencies. However',\n",

Address correspondence to lvzhihan@gmail.com This work aims to explore the impact of Digital Twins T echnology on industrial manufacturing in the context of Industry 5.0. A computer is used to search the Web of Science database to summarize the Digital Twins in Industry 5.0. First, the background and system architecture of Industry 5.0 are introduced. Then, the potential applications and key modeling technologies in Industry 5.0 are discussd. It is found that equipment is the infrastructure of industrial scenarios, and the embedded intelligent upgrade for equipment is a Digital Twins primary condition. At the same time, Digital Twins can provide automated real-time process analysis between connected machines and data sources, speeding up error detection and correction. In addition, Digital Twins can bring obvious efficiency improvements and cost reductions to industrial manufacturing. Digital Twins reflects its potential application value and subsequent potential value in Industry 5.0 through the prospect. It is hoped that this relatively systematic overview can provide technical reference for the intelligent development of industrial manufacturing and the improvement of the efficiency of the entire business process in the Industrial X.0 era. Introduction The manufacturing industry has transformed rapidly, and man - ufacturers worldwide face the challenge of improving produc - tivity. Germany introduced Industry 4.0 in 2011 to improve its industrial competitiveness. Industry 4.0 is founded on the division of industrial development phases. Initially, Industry 1.0 announced the epoch of the steam engine. Industry 2.0 is a revolution of electricity. Industry 3.0 was born as the informa - tion age, and Industry 4.0 was the age of intelligence that used information technology to promote industrial upgrades. The Fifth Industrial Revolution is proposed by the European Union in 2021 as the Internet and artificial intelligence era in industrial design and manufacturing. It considers people orientation, sustainability, and flexibility. Xu et al. revealed that Industry 4.0 is considered technolo - gy-driven, while 5IR is value-driven. Mourtzis believed that the focus of 5IR should be on the design and development of a suitable framework to achieve process optimization based on semantic integration through the effective use of big data. 5IR is still an industrial vision for developed countries because of limited efficiency and productivity. In particular, it strengthens the role and contribution of industry to society. 5IR is still a future orientation for most enterprises, where the potential of the Industry 4.0 era must be fully tapped. Thereby, it helps realize the leap from technology to leadership, coordinate resources and cross functions, handle the operational intelli - gence data provided by digitalization, and be more predictable to work units and factories. Emerging technologies are applied in modern industrial production. Digital Twins Technology fully uses data such as physical models, sensor updates, and operation history to integrate multidisciplinary, multiphysical, multiscale, and multiprobability simulation processes. DT can collect various physical models information through simulation technology and map a digital virtual twin of the real entities. In this sense, DT can monitor digital entities and operating indi - cators in real time. It projects the natural world through data accumulation and AI and feeds back the results to the real world. Statistics show that 85% of Internet of Things -native devices use DT to safeguard Information Security. Therefore, DT-powered smart city construction has become a research hotspot.
